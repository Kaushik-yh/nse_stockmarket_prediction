# Stock Prediction App
This application predicts the Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) values for 30 different stocks from the Indian stock market. 
The model generates predictions for the next day's stock prices based on the historical data of the past 128 days.

The AI model is built using TensorFlow's transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, which allows it to effectively capture complex patterns and dependencies in the time series data. 
By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model provides a more sophisticated approach to stock price prediction compared to traditional methods.

With an accuracy of up to 60%, the model has been shown to outperform commonly used indicators like the 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day moving averages, offering a more reliable prediction for short-term stock price movements. 
This makes the app a valuable tool for individuals or professionals looking to make informed decisions in the Indian stock market.
